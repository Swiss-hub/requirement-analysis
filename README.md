# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
The Requirement Analysis Project simulates a real-world development scenario to help learners master the foundational phase of software development: requirement analysis. Through a series of structured tasks, participants will analyze, document, and visualize requirements for a **Booking Management System**, laying the groundwork for successful implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
This project equips developers with skills to:
- Understand and apply methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
- Translate business needs into clear, structured documentation.
- Identify and classify functional vs. non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
- Use tools like **Draw.io** to create visual representations of system interactions.
- Define precise acceptance criteria aligned with user and business goals.
- Produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

## âœ… Requirements
To complete this project, learners should:
- Have a GitHub account and understand repository basics.
- Be proficient in writing markdown (`README.md` files).
- Understand SDLC phases and the significance of requirement analysis.
- Know how to use **Draw.io** (or similar tools) for diagramming.
- Be able to articulate use cases, system requirements, and acceptance criteria.
- Reference the provided case study for context.

## âœ¨ Key Highlights
- **Real-world Simulation**: Experience practical requirement analysis tasks.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Learn to write detailed requirement specifications.
- **Visual Design**: Use diagrams to illustrate system actors and interactions.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define success parameters to guide development.
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Build knowledge incrementally through tasks.
- **Professional Standards**: Follow best practices for real client-ready documentation.
